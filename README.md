<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a comprehensive personal website built with `Jekyll` and hosted on `GitHub Pages`, based on the `Neumorphism` theme developed by `longpdo` (cf. Acknowledgements).

The development-customization process included personal layout/font/colour/imagery expression, responsive design improvements, SEO implementation, and integration of modern web features such as Google Analytics 4, automated sitemap generation and a bug reporting system. 

The majority of the technical work was efficiently accomplished with GitHub Copilot's assistance (credit where credit is due ;D); this allowed me to focus on the aesthetic, content and debugging of the website.
