## About The Project

This is a personal website built with `Jekyll` and hosted on `Github Pages`, which is based on the `Neumorphism` theme developed by `longpdo` (cf. Acknowledgements) and was developed with a mobile-first approach. Most of the work were done by GitHub Copilot ;).

I spent around a day working on features, layout customization, font and colouring. Another half a day was spent on debugging (to be fair Copilot did an amazing job!).
