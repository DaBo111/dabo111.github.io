about_me_description: Hi there! Name's Dat Nguyen Tien Hoang (Dat, /É—aÃ¢Ë€t/, good luck pronouning that ðŸ˜œ). Just a nerd interested in autonomous, self-organized artificial swarms and decentralized multi-agent systems. Currently, I am doing a MSc in theoretical Computer Science research, specifically focusing on model checking and other formal methods for multi-agent systems.<br><br>Mathematics, physics and all things space-related also pique my interest. I also fancy playing the guitar and singing, though one would not want to be part of the audience for the sake of their auditory faculty...<br><br>I will update any future projects that I (will, hopefully) undertake on this website; also gonna post some (unhinged?) takes on various topics in the <a href="#blogs" class="highlight-link">Blog section</a> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.
