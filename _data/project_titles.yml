# Map repository names to custom titles, descriptions, images, and categories
# Format:
# repository-name:
#   title: "Custom Title"
#   description: "Custom description for your project"
#   image: "/assets/img/projects/project-name.png" # Path to project image
#   category: "Web Development" # Project category for filtering
# 
# Or for title only (backward compatibility):
# repository-name: "Custom Title"
